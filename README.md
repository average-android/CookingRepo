# CookingRepo

As a user, I want a site to help prepare for cooking during the week of Thanksgiving.
As a user, I want a landing page that explains what the site is for.
As a user, I want a page where I can look up meal and cocktail recipes that I can save.
As a user, I want a page with a scheduler for the two days leading up to Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving day that I can enter in the different recipes and other things I may need to do.


A website dedicated to helping plan Thanksgiving preparation by providing a page to search and save recipes and a scheduler to plan for when each dish needs to be made.

Our motivation stemmed from the fact that Thanksgiving is approaching and our families are already planning the dishes to be made. For people who need to make more than one dish, figuring out the timing can be difficult, as one thing taking longer than expected can lead to a dish being forgotten.
